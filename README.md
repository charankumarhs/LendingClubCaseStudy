## General Information
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a
return. Once the company has decided to approve the loan request, there is a certain risk taken whether it would be successfully returned or the applicant will default. 
- We are tasked here in identifying the factors which might help in identifying factors which lead for borrowers to default or charge-off. 
- If the lending club can identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case
- Dataset used here for the applications received by the lending club which has information relating to loan, along with other characterstics associated with applicant background.


## Conclusions
- Identified factors which can trigger a loan applicant which is likely to be charged off without compromising on good applications. A few mentioned below:
- Borrowers having longer term for repayment showed high tendencies to default
- Income verified people also present higher default rate, so some new measures need to be implemented while verifying to access the financial stability of borrower
- Club assigns some grades to the borrowers. From their classification, a few groups with grades A, B, C came out highly profitable and others not so much
- Sub-Grades are also introduced to have more insights before makinf decisions
- Impact of owning their residence is analyzed. And people renting their houses are found more likely to default
- The maximum loans apporved were between range 5k-15k. So the approval rate is high within this window
- Employment length found to be deceiving as it really had no pattern with regards to repayment prediction.
