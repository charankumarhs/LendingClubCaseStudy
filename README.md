## General Information
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a
return. Once the company has decided to approve the loan request, there is a certain risk taken whether it would be successfully returned or the applicant will default. 
- We are tasked here in identifying the factors which might help in identifying factors which lead for borrowers to default or charge-off. 
- If the lending club can identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case
- Dataset used here for the applications received by the lending club which has information relating to loan, along with other characterstics associated with applicant background.


## Conclusions
- Identified factors which can trigger a loan applicant which is likely to be charged off without compromising on good applications
